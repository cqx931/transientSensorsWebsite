<i>The Plant Quartett</i> is a sound composition that provides an ambient listening experience of plants by using multiple Soniplasts. Similar as Chloroplasts, which are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plants, a soniplast takes bioelectric potential data from a plant and translates it into sound. The generated sound may also be manipulated by another audio input, which can be from another soniplast or any other audio source. <br><br>The Plant Quartett pays attention to the different rhythmic cycles among plants and how they contribute together to a musical composition. The aim of the project is to encourage an intimate yet playful relationship with plants in a slow, subtle and collective manner.
