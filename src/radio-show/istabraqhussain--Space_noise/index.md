This is an interactional art project that invites people to play a game with each other, and at the same time make improvisation with each other. <br><br>
The game is based on the famous Atari game ‘Asteroids’, which was recreated using Processing, playing the game also controls four Oscillators in Pure Date (2 oscillators for each Space ship) and these two Oscillators attempt to create Amplitude Modulation, the rotation of the ship is the Carrier signal and moving upwards or downwards with the ship controls the modulated signal.<br><br>
The winner of the game is the player that destroys the other ship before getting shot or hit by floating asteroids, by dodging and shooting different sized Asteroids, and trying to shoot a laser at the opponent, the two players are also making sound improvisations together.
