This project seeks to explore the capacity of piezoelectricity present in some crystals to create algorithmic compositions.
In this round, I specifically focused on tourmaline as interface and source. Through experimentation with raw materials, it attempt to create musical pieces that somehow confront the "natural" (crystals) with the mechanistic (algorithmic/software). <br><br>The set up consist in a circuit connected to an Arduino UNO where a tourmaline stone is attached at one end. Then, a Processing software maps the electrical signals from the crystal when it is touched. Rather than just noticing and showing the interference of the human presence, the software is programmed to calculate a number of formulas that order to creates the final composition.
