The Session is an auditory collection of 3 skateboard tricks, each becoming the cynosure of its own track. As a skateboard trick is usually only a couple of seconds at most, and fleeting in nature, this project aims to capture data produced by the motion and sound of the trick, and allow each trick to be experienced under a kind of audio microscope. This way of experiencing a skateboard trick allows the listener to have a more intimate understanding of skateboarding, and perhaps a broader appreciation for the patience, practice, craft and art that goes into these ephemeral glimpses of skill.

The Kickflip is the first track from the collection, and is presented as part of Transient Sensors and the Eternal Algorithmic Composition.
